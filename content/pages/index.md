    WRFG 89.3 FM is an independent, non-profit, community radio station in Georgia that is dedicated to providing unique programming that reflects progressive perspectives and the diversity of people, ideas, and cultural expressions that embody that spirit, WRFG is a like breath of fresh air on the radio dial.

    Since 1973, WRFG has been broadcasting an invigorating mix of programming that has made us a favorite among discerning listeners:

    * Hand-Picked Music that spans a multitude of cultures:  Zydeco, Blues, Jazz, Celtic, Folk, Caribbean, Indian, R&B, Doo-Wop, Latin, Bluegrass, Hip Hop…. and many more!
    * Public Affairs that address topics of concern to us all – health and nutrition, the environment, peace and justice, animal rights, race/gender issues, the economy, workers’ rights, poverty issues.
    * News from around the world and around the neighborhood that tends to get ignored or shortchanged in other media outlets – locally-produced shows along with national programs like Democracy Now!

    We stream worldwide at wrfg.org bringing WRFG to the world … and the world to WRFG.

    The goal of WRFG’s programming is to uplift human dignity by providing truthful, useful information, and music that touches our collective soul.

    Our greatest accomplishment, though, is the support of thousands of listeners who understand the importance of independent media.  Media consolidation means fewer and fewer companies own more and more media outlets that control what you hear, read and see, and what you don’t.

    Now that’s scary!

    In order to remain independent, financially stable, and relevant to the needs of the community, WRFG 89.3 FM relies on the continuing support of people who understand the urgent need for noncommercial, diverse, community radio. We hope you will become a donor to WRFG.  The end of the year is coming fast and you can make your 2019 tax-deductible donation at wrfg.org, or mail it to WRFG 1083 Austin Ave. NE, Atlanta, GA. 30307.
