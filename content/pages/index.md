  content: "Since 1973, WRFG has been broadcasting an invigorating mix of programming
    that has made us a favorite among discerning listeners:\n\n* Hand-picked quality
    music that spans a multitude of cultures:  Zydeco, Blues, Jazz, Celtic, Folk,
    Caribbean, Indian, R&B, Doo-Wop, Latin, Bluegrass, Hip Hop…. and many more!\n*
    Public Affairs that address topics of concern to us all: health and nutrition,
    the environment, peace and justice, animal rights, race, gender, the economy,
    workers’ rights, poverty.\n* News from around the world and around the neighborhood
    that tends to get ignored or shortchanged in other media outlets – locally-produced
    shows along with national programs like Democracy Now!\n\nWe stream worldwide
    at wrfg.org bringing WRFG to the world … and the world to WRFG.\n\nThe goal of
    WRFG’s programming is to uplift human dignity by providing truthful, useful information,
    and music that touches our collective soul.\n\nOur greatest accomplishment, though,
    is the support of thousands of listeners who understand the importance of independent
    media.\n\nMedia consolidation means that fewer and fewer megacorporations own
    more and more of the radio, newspaper, and television outlets that control what
    you hear, read and see — and what you don’t. Now that’s scary!\n\nWe encourage
    you to become a donor. Please [click here](/donate) to make your tax-deductible
    donation, or you can mail it to WRFG at 1083 Austin Avenue NE, Atlanta, GA 30307.
    Every donation, no matter the size, is important and appreciated! "
