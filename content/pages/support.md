    #### Underwriting

    As a non-commercial station, WRFG is not allowed to broadcast commercials. Commercial media and its broadcast content is largely determined by advertisers.

    Non-commercial stations are allowed to do underwriting. Underwriting means that a business or organization can sponsor WRFG’s programming generally and receive on-air acknowledgement on the programs of their choice.

    All announcements are to be value-neutral, cannot list prices, or inducements to buy goods or services. They contain a brief description of the business, organization or event, pertinent logistical information and contact information.

    All contracts require a minimum of 5 spots, payment should accompany the signed contract and submitted at least three business days prior to when the announcements are to air. Sponsorship of our programming has no influence on the content of our programs.

    A wide variety of businesses and groups find WRFG a useful platform for communicating with the public. Underwriting announcements on WRFG are designed to give listeners valuable information about your business, organization or event.

    In short, underwriting is a way for you to financially support WRFG, your community station, and receive recognition for your business or organization as a community-minded entity.

    Our loyal listeners tend to support the businesses and organizations that support and share their interests.

    WRFG is licensed to broadcast at 100,000 watts of power, has a 100 mile [broadcast radius](/uploads/coverage-map.gif) and streams worldwide 24 hours a day/7 days a week. No other station can claim the audience diversity and loyalty that WRFG has enjoyed for over four decades. As varied as our programs are, you will find a perfect fit for your announcements on WRFG.

    #### Paid Public Services Announcements

    In addition to Underwriting, WRFG can air Public Service Announcements (PSAs) for nonprofit 501(c)3 organizations. PSAs are randomly announced by our on-air staff.

    Paid Public Service Announcement are produced and played on the programs selected by the nonprofit organization. There is a minimum of 5 announcements required.

    Scripts for PSAs should be less than 30 seconds and contain basic information such as name or title of the event, date, location, times and sponsoring organization, plus a brief sentence about its purpose. No command verbs such as “Come, Join, Be There” can be included. No prices including the word “free” can be part of the PSA script. All scripts should be sent to the office@wrfg.org e-mail no less than two weeks in advance of the event.

    All scripts will be approved and edited if necessary before airing on WRFG.

    All PSAs are followed by the tag line “This public service announcement is brought to you by your community sponsored and supported radio station, WRFG 89.3FM, wrfg.org, your station for progressive information.”
