  content: "## Mission\n\nWRFG 89.3 FM Radio Free Georgia Broadcasting provides a
    voice for those who have been traditionally denied open access to the broadcast
    media through the involvement of a broad base of community elements to guarantee
    that access.\n\nIn the utilization of the station's facilities and in its programs
    the following communities will receive first priority:\n\n1. Those who continue
    to be denied free and open access to the broadcast media,\n2. Those who suffer
    oppression or exploitation based upon class, race, sex, age, creed, sexual orientation,
    disability, or immigrant status.\n\n## History\n\nWRFG 89.3 FM has been Atlanta’s
    community radio station, an independent, listener-supported, non-profit media
    outlet for local musicians, artists, community voices and progressive ideas for
    over four decades.\n\nSince going on the air in 1973, WRFG has filled a void on
    the Atlanta airwaves. Reflecting Atlanta’s emergence as an “international city”,
    it pioneered programming oriented toward the area’s growing Latin, African, Asian
    and Caribbean communities.\n\nWRFG was the first station to carry live broadcasts
    from the Arts Festival of Atlanta and the Georgia Grassroots Festival.\n\nWRFG’s
    achievements extend beyond music alone. WRFG produced live broadcasts of speakers
    at the Hungry Club, Atlanta’s famous weekly interracial forum.\n\nBetween 1977
    and 1980, WRFG produced the 50-part “Living Atlanta” series on Atlanta’s history.
    “Living Atlanta” won national awards and established a tradition of documentary
    excellence at WRFG.\n\nIn 2003, WRFG hosted the last FCC public hearing in the
    country on Media Deregulation. The event was broadcast nationally.\n\nTo learn
