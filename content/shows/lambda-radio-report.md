Lambda Radio is feminist practice. As a radio news program we cover all progressive issues the have and impact on those who survive and work through systems of oppression. We critique social structures of oppression such as Abalism, Classism, Homophia, Racism and Sexism. We seek to dismantle these structures with the tools of Queer Theory, Critical Race Theory, Intersectionality and Human Rights. Although this seems like a difficult task, we do it with style, entertainment, interviews, speeches and LOVE.

Hosted by Charone Pagett.
