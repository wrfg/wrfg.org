Atlanta’s Latin Flavor. Serenata Latina is all about the music and the stories behind the music. Learn about the personal and cultural backgrounds of our many rhythms and artists. Who’s leading the revival of “Salsa Gorda” in New York…Who spent over two years working at a laundromat reeling over an unsuccessful debut and then crafted a sophomore effort which became a million seller…What was the real origin of the late Celia Cruz battle cry of AZUCAR!!!

Tune in every Saturday 7-10 PM!

Hosted by Jose Jimenez.
