I cook up the Blues every Tuesday morning from 8-10AM…in AJ’s Blues Kitchen, just the way you like it. From old time blues to contemporary blues, it’s all handpicked and commercial free for our listeners.

Our Blues air-shifters are the proud recipients of the 2005 “KEEPING THE BLUES ALIVE” Award from the Blues Foundation.

We love e-mail from our listeners, so drop us a line at [ajsatlantablues@aol.com](email:ajsatlantablues@aol.com) if you have a favorite song you want to hear, have suggestions or need any information regarding our playlists.
