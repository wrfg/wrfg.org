Funk & soul MOD from Sarf London I was gluing NME cuttings to my bedroom walls at age 10 of Small Faces, Who, Chris Farlowe, Prince Buster, Skatalites, etc. It wasn’t until I was 35 I realized the blues source of the 60’s music explosion in the Stones, Animals, F Mac, Free. I then dug deeper to the glorious roots that spread out into Calypso, Mento & Ska taken from all the Louisiana styles that were in the airwaves those islands were absorbing.

London club dance floors were where you MET people and if the groove moved you, it was the basis to develop that mutual buzz with mates and birds alike – WE SHAKE HIPS NOT HANDS.

Today in hosting our award winning morning drive time program my mission hasn’t changed: it’s a quest to bring all those sounds my body soaked in and make them available to the Atlanta community along with the LIVE interaction of the FAMOUS artists that created them. Plug in anecdotes and knowledge that moors this music alongside today’s new breeds of blues and……. VOILA MON CHERIE…you have LONDON TO LOUISIANA!
