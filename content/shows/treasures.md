One of my most cherished treasures is my music collection. I treat it like a geological dig where different types of precious and semi-precious stones are excavated. They are cleaned and polished for presentation to prospective buyers. In my case, that presentation is to the listener.

Treasures attempts to air music from the 50s to the present. I will play flip sides and album cuts that are not often heard on the radio. I will also present special programs from time to time, highlighting an artist or a group, a sub-genre, or an instrument.

This type of program along with offerings from the rest of the Soul Rhapsody Air Shifters is what sets WRFG apart from oldie programs on other stations.

Hosted by Lamar, Your Musical Geologist.
